To convert an Opus cache into the UrbanSim-2 hdf5 file, go into data/conversion and follow the README file there. 

To explore data using the DataFrameExplorer, open explore.py and set your input data file and geography. Then run the file. In a browser go to localhost:8765. See http://synthicity.github.io/urbansim/maps/index.html for help, especially the Website Description section.
